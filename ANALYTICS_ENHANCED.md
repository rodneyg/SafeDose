# Enhanced Analytics Implementation

## Overview

The SafeDose app now includes a comprehensive cross-platform analytics system that works on Web, iOS, Android, and server environments.

## Architecture

### Web Platform
- Uses Firebase Analytics with proper support checking
- Full Firebase Analytics features available
- Real-time event tracking to Firebase console

### React Native Platform (iOS/Android)
- Structured analytics logging with local storage
- Events stored locally for future batch upload
- Ready for integration with native Firebase Analytics or other services
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Server Platform
- Enhanced server-side analytics for Stripe webhooks
- Structured logging for revenue events
- Ready for Firebase Admin SDK integration

## Features

### Event Tracking
- Cross-platform `logAnalyticsEvent()` function
- Consistent API across all platforms
- Automatic platform detection
- Graceful fallbacks for unsupported environments

### User Properties
- Cross-platform user property setting
- Local storage on React Native
- Firebase Analytics integration on web

### Revenue Tracking
- Built-in revenue event tracking
- Stripe webhook integration
- Subscription lifecycle events

### Retention Analysis
- Automated retention milestone tracking
- Day 1, 7, and 30 retention events
- Local storage for offline tracking

## Usage

```typescript
import { logAnalyticsEvent, ANALYTICS_EVENTS } from '../lib/analytics';

// Log an event
logAnalyticsEvent(ANALYTICS_EVENTS.SCAN_SUCCESS, {
  scan_type: 'automatic',
  processing_time: 2.5
});

// Track revenue
trackRevenue(29.99, 'USD', 'plus_plan');

// Set user properties
setPersonalizationUserProperties(userProfile);
```

## Local Storage (React Native)

Analytics events are stored locally on React Native platforms in the following format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-10T02:52:29.540Z",
  "platform": "react-native", 
  "event": "scan_success",
  "parameters": {
    "scan_type": "automatic",
    "processing_time": 2.5
  }
}
```

Events can be retrieved and uploaded to analytics services using:
- `getPendingAnalyticsEvents()` - Get stored events
- `clearPendingAnalyticsEvents()` - Clear after successful upload

## Future Enhancements

1. **Native Firebase Analytics**: Integrate React Native Firebase for full analytics
2. **Batch Upload**: Implement batch upload of stored events
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Add real-time analytics viewing
4. **Custom Metrics**: Add app-specific performance metrics
5. **A/B Testing**: Integrate with Firebase Remote Config

## Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Analytics | User Properties | Revenue Tracking | Local Storage |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Web      | ✅ Firebase | ✅ Firebase    | ✅ Firebase     | ❌ N/A       |
| iOS      | ✅ Local   | ✅ Local       | ✅ Local        | ✅ Yes       |
| Android  | ✅ Local   | ✅ Local       | ✅ Local        | ✅ Yes       |
| Server   | ✅ Console | ❌ N/A         | ✅ Console      | ❌ N/A       |

The implementation provides a solid foundation for comprehensive analytics while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing code.

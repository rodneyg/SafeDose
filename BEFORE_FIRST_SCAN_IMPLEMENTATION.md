# Before First Scan Feature - Implementation Documentation

## Overview
The Before First Scan feature provides users with helpful guidance about materials they should prepare before attempting their first scan with SafeDose. This ensures better scan success rates and user experience.

## User Experience Flow

### First Time User Journey
1. **User opens SafeDose** → Sees IntroScreen with "Scan" and "Manual Entry" buttons
2. **User presses "Scan" button** → System checks if before first scan prompt should be shown
3. **BeforeFirstScanScreen appears** → User sees material preparation guidance
4. **User presses "Continue to Scan"** → Navigates to camera/scan screen
5. **Analytics tracked** → System logs prompt shown event

### Second Time User Journey  
1. **User presses "Scan" again** (in future session) → System shows prompt again
2. **BeforeFirstScanScreen appears with "Don't show again" option** → User can opt out
3. **User presses "Don't show again"** → System saves preference and goes to scan
4. **Analytics tracked** → System logs don't show again event

### Subsequent Usage
- **Users who selected "Don't show again"** → Go directly to scan screen
- **Users who saw prompt 2 times** → Go directly to scan screen (automatic limit)

## UI Design and Content

### BeforeFirstScanScreen Components

#### Header Section
- **Icon**: Camera icon in blue circle background
- **Title**: "Before you scan" 
- **Subtitle**: "Let's make sure you have what you need"

#### Materials Preparation Section
- **Background**: Light gray container with rounded corners
- **Title**: "Have at least one of these ready:"
- **Materials List** (with green checkmarks):
  - Medication vial with clear labels
  - Syringe with visible markings  
  - Prescription box or label

#### General Rule Section
- **Title**: "General rule:"
- **Content**: "SafeDose works best with at least one solid baseline reference. Clear text and markings help ensure accurate readings."

#### Action Buttons
- **Primary Button**: "Continue to Scan" (blue, with arrow icon)
- **Secondary Button**: "Back" (gray)
- **Optional**: "Don't show again" (small, bottom, only after first viewing)

### Visual Design Principles
- **Clean, medical-focused aesthetic** following existing SafeDose design
- **Clear typography hierarchy** with readable fonts and spacing
- **Consistent color scheme** (blue primary, gray secondary)
- **Mobile-responsive design** that works on all screen sizes
- **Accessibility considerations** with proper contrast and button sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components
- `BeforeFirstScanScreen.tsx` - Main UI component
- `useBeforeFirstScanPrompt.ts` - State management hook
- Updated `useDoseCalculator.ts` - Navigation logic
- Updated `IntroScreen.tsx` - Scan button integration
- Updated `new-dose.tsx` - Screen rendering

### Analytics Tracking
- `BEFORE_FIRST_SCAN_PROMPT_SHOWN` - When prompt is displayed
- `BEFORE_FIRST_SCAN_CONTINUE` - When user continues to scan
- `BEFORE_FIRST_SCAN_DONT_SHOW_AGAIN` - When user opts out

### Storage Keys
- `beforeFirstScanPromptShown_{userId}` - Show count per user
- `beforeFirstScanDontShowAgain_{userId}` - Opt-out preference per user

## Business Logic Rules

### Show Logic
```typescript
shouldShowPrompt = !isLoading && !dontShowAgain && showCount < 2
```

### Show Count Limits
- **Maximum 2 times** per user across all sessions
- **Resets only if user data is cleared** (respects user preferences)

### Don't Show Again
- **Available after first viewing** (showCount > 0)
- **Immediately stops future prompts** regardless of show count
- **Permanent preference** stored per user

## Error Handling
- **Storage failures** → Gracefully defaults to not showing prompt
- **Component errors** → Falls back to direct scan navigation
- **Analytics failures** → Continues normal flow without blocking user

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** for hook logic and show/hide conditions
- **Integration tests** for complete user journeys
- **Manual testing** for UI and user experience validation

## Accessibility Features
- **Screen reader support** with proper accessibility labels
- **Keyboard navigation** for web users
- **High contrast compliance** with readable text and buttons
- **Touch target sizing** following mobile accessibility guidelines

## Performance Considerations
- **Lightweight component** with minimal dependencies
- **Async storage operations** don't block UI rendering
- **Lazy analytics** calls don't impact navigation speed
- **Optimized re-renders** using React best practices

## Success Metrics
- **Prompt engagement rate** - How many users interact vs skip
- **Scan success rate** - Whether prompts improve first scan success
- **User preference adoption** - Usage of "don't show again" feature
- **Support ticket reduction** - Fewer scanning-related help requests

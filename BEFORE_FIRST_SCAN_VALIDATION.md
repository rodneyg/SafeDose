## UX Principles Compliance (Laws of UX)

### ✅ Jakob's Law
**Principle**: Users expect interfaces to work like other apps they know
- ✅ **Standard Patterns**: Uses familiar modal/screen pattern
- ✅ **Button Conventions**: Primary/secondary button hierarchy
- ✅ **Navigation**: Standard back button and continue flow

### ✅ Miller's Rule  
**Principle**: Average person can only keep 7 (±2) items in working memory
- ✅ **Limited Options**: Only 3 material types listed
- ✅ **Simple Choices**: Continue, Back, Don't show again (max 3 actions)
- ✅ **Chunked Information**: Materials grouped together, rule separate

### ✅ Hick's Law
**Principle**: Time to make decision increases with number of choices
- ✅ **Minimal Choices**: Primary action is clear (Continue)
- ✅ **Visual Hierarchy**: Most important action stands out
- ✅ **Progressive Disclosure**: Don't show again only when relevant

### ✅ Fitts's Law
**Principle**: Time to acquire target depends on distance and size
- ✅ **Large Touch Targets**: Buttons are appropriately sized
- ✅ **Thumb-Friendly**: Primary action in easy reach
- ✅ **Spacing**: Adequate space between interactive elements

### ✅ Law of Proximity
**Principle**: Related items should be grouped together
- ✅ **Material Grouping**: All materials in same container
- ✅ **Button Grouping**: Actions grouped at bottom
- ✅ **Visual Separation**: Different sections clearly divided

### ✅ Law of Common Region
**Principle**: Elements in same region are perceived as grouped
- ✅ **Container Design**: Materials in gray background container
- ✅ **Header Region**: Title and icon grouped visually
- ✅ **Action Region**: Buttons grouped in bottom area

### ✅ Serial Position Effect
**Principle**: Users remember first and last items best
- ✅ **Important First**: Vial listed first (most common)
- ✅ **Clear Last**: Prescription info last (often available)
- ✅ **Strong Close**: Continue button prominently placed

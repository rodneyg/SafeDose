# Child Safety Features Implementation

This document describes the implementation of child safety features in SafeDose to provide appropriate guidance and warnings for underage users.

## Overview

The child safety features enhance the onboarding flow by:
1. **Collecting user age early** in the onboarding process
2. **Providing specialized safety guidance** for users under 18
3. **Maintaining professional appearance** while being gentle and supportive

## New Onboarding Flow

### Previous Flow
```
Welcome → Demo → User Type → Main App
```

### New Flow
```
Welcome → Age Collection → [Child Safety (if <18)] → Demo → User Type → Main App
```

## New Screens

### 1. Age Collection Screen (`/onboarding/age`)
- **Purpose**: Collect user age for safety and personalization
- **Features**:
  - Professional, clean interface with Calendar icon
  - Numeric input validation (13-120 age range)
  - Skip option ("Prefer not to answer")
  - Privacy notice explaining why age is collected
  - Mobile-responsive design

### 2. Child Safety Screen (`/onboarding/child-safety`)
- **Purpose**: Provide gentle safety guidance for users under 18
- **Features**:
  - Supportive messaging with Shield icon
  - Clear recommendations to consult trusted adults
  - "Find Help & Resources" button with comprehensive guidance
  - Professional medical advice disclaimer
  - Encourages consultation with parents, healthcare providers, pharmacists

## Routing Logic

```typescript
// Age collection routing
if (age < 18) {
  // Route to child safety screen
  router.push('/onboarding/child-safety');
} else {
  // Route directly to demo
  router.push('/onboarding/demo');
}

// Skip age collection
router.push('/onboarding/demo'); // No age restrictions
```

## Analytics Integration

### New Events
- `age_collection_shown` - When age collection screen is displayed
- `age_collection_completed` - When user provides age (includes age and age_range)
- `age_collection_skipped` - When user skips age entry
- `child_safety_screen_shown` - When child safety screen is displayed
- `child_safety_continue` - When user continues from safety screen
- `child_safety_seek_help` - When user clicks help resources

### Enhanced Existing Events
- `onboarding_complete` - Now includes age and age_range fields

## Technical Implementation

### Type Updates
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  // ... existing fields
  age?: number; // New optional age field
}

type UserProfileAnswers = {
  // ... existing fields
  age: number | null; // New age field in answers
}
```

### Age Range Classification
- `minor`: Under 18 years
- `adult`: 18-64 years  
- `senior`: 65+ years
- `unknown`: Age not provided

## Child Safety Guidance

The child safety screen provides gentle, supportive guidance including:

### Recommended Contacts
- Parents or guardians

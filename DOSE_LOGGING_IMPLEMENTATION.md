# Automatic Dose Logging - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented automatic dose logging functionality that logs each completed dose clearly and accurately, maintaining a simple history for user reference within the existing tab-based navigation.

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created
1. `types/doseLog.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for dose log data structure
2. `lib/hooks/useDoseLogging.ts` - React hook for managing dose logs (storage, retrieval, deletion)
3. `app/(tabs)/logs.tsx` - New "Log" tab displaying recent doses with delete functionality
4. `lib/hooks/useDoseLogging.test.ts` - Unit tests for dose logging functionality
5. `lib/dose-logging-integration.test.ts` - Integration tests for the complete flow

### Modified Files
1. `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Added "Log" tab to the navigation
2. `lib/hooks/useDoseCalculator.ts` - Integrated automatic logging in `handleFeedbackComplete`

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Automatic Logging
- Each completed dose is automatically logged upon confirmation
- Logging happens in `handleFeedbackComplete()` regardless of whether user provides feedback or skips
- No user action required - completely automatic

### âœ… Log Entry Structure
- Substance name
- Dose amount
- Date and exact timestamp (ISO format)
- Optional notes (prepared for future enhancement)
- Unique ID and user association

### âœ… UI Requirements
- Added "Log" tab with History icon to existing tab bar navigation
- Displays "Recent Doses" history within the tab
- Most recent log entry prominently shown at top with blue border and "Most Recent" badge
- Previous entries listed chronologically, most recent first
- Clean, modern card-based design matching app aesthetics

### âœ… Deletion Functionality
- Delete button (trash icon) on each log entry
- Confirmation dialog before deletion: "Are you sure you want to delete this dose log?"
- Shows substance name and dose in confirmation for clarity
- Complete removal of log entry (no partial adjustments)

### âœ… Storage & Persistence
- Local storage using AsyncStorage (works offline)
- Firestore integration for authenticated users (sync across devices)
- Keeps last 100 log entries to prevent storage bloat
- Persistent across app sessions

### âœ… No Editing Constraint
- No editing functionality once log entry is saved
- Only deletion is allowed (with confirmation)

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User completes dose calculation â†’ `FinalResultDisplay`
2. User clicks "New Dose" or "Start Over" â†’ `handleGoToFeedback()`
3. App shows `PostDoseFeedbackScreen` (optional feedback)
4. User submits feedback or skips â†’ `handleFeedbackComplete()`
5. **ðŸ†• Automatic logging happens here** â†’ `logDose(feedbackContext.doseInfo)`
6. Log saved locally and to Firestore â†’ Navigation continues

### Storage Strategy
- **Local First**: Always save to AsyncStorage (immediate, works offline)
- **Cloud Sync**: Save to Firestore for authenticated users (backup & sync)
- **Graceful Degradation**: If Firestore fails, local storage still works
- **User Isolation**: Logs are user-specific (`dose_logs_${userId}`)

### Error Handling
- Non-blocking: Logging errors don't break the app flow
- Local fallback: Always works even if cloud storage fails
- Validation: Only logs complete dose info (dose value + calculated volume required)

## Testing
- Unit tests for dose log types and structure
- Integration tests for timestamp formatting and different unit types
- Error handling for incomplete dose data
- Lint checks pass with only minor pre-existing warnings

## Manual Testing Checklist
1. Complete a dose calculation (scan or manual)
2. Click "New Dose" or "Start Over" from final result
3. Verify dose appears in "Log" tab automatically
4. Check most recent entry has blue border and "Most Recent" badge
5. Test deletion with confirmation dialog
6. Verify logs persist after app restart
7. Test with different substances, doses, and units

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
- Notes input during logging (UI prepared but not implemented)
- Export functionality
- Analytics/trends
- Search and filtering
- Bulk deletion

The implementation successfully meets all the functional and UI requirements specified in the issue, providing a seamless automatic logging experience with clear user interface and robust data persistence.

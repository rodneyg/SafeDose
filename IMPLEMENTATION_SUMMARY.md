## 🧠 AI Recommendation Features

### Historical Analysis
- **Dose Averaging**: Calculates mean dose from recent history
- **Variability Assessment**: Standard deviation analysis for consistency
- **Trend Detection**: Identifies increasing, decreasing, or stable patterns
- **Adherence Scoring**: Measures logging consistency over time

### Injection Site Intelligence
- **Rotation Tracking**: Monitors usage of 8 anatomical sites
- **Overuse Detection**: Warns when sites are used too frequently
- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests least-used or unused sites
- **Rotation Scoring**: Percentage-based rotation quality metric

### Confidence Scoring
**Factors Considered**:
- Historical data volume (more data = higher confidence)
- Dose consistency (low variability = higher confidence)
- User adherence patterns (consistent logging = higher confidence)
- Trend stability (consistent trends = higher confidence)

**Score Ranges**:
- 70%+ = High Confidence (Green indicator)
- 40-69% = Medium Confidence (Amber indicator)
- <40% = Low Confidence (Red indicator, extra warnings)

### Side Effect Prediction
- **Feedback Analysis**: Reviews historical user feedback for patterns
- **Substance-Specific Risks**: Tailored warnings (e.g., hypoglycemia for insulin)
- **Dose-Response Relationships**: Higher doses trigger appropriate warnings
- **Risk Categorization**: Low, moderate, high risk levels with specific messaging

## 🎮 Gamification System

### Progress Tracking
- **Daily Streaks**: Consecutive days of dose logging
- **Point System**: Rewards for consistent use and safety practices
- **Level Progression**: Advancement based on accumulated points
- **Badge System**: Achievements for milestones and behaviors

### Engagement Features
- **Streak Visualization**: Current and longest streak display
- **Next Reward Preview**: Shows upcoming achievements
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback on advancement
- **Category-Based Badges**: Consistency, safety, community, learning

## 🔒 Safety & Privacy Features

### Multi-Level Disclaimers
- **Standard**: Basic AI disclaimer for typical recommendations
- **Enhanced**: Additional warnings for moderate risk scenarios
- **Critical**: Strong warnings for high-risk situations or low confidence

### Privacy-First Design
- **Local Processing**: Core analysis happens on-device
- **Optional Cloud Sync**: User-controlled data sharing
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected
- **HIPAA-Ready Architecture**: Designed for healthcare compliance

### Fallback Mechanisms
- **Rule-Based Backup**: When AI fails, use mathematical rules
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user notification
- **Safe Defaults**: Conservative recommendations when uncertain
- **Professional Consultation**: Always encouraged regardless of confidence

## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User History → Pattern Analysis → Risk Assessment → 
Confidence Calculation → Recommendation Generation → UI Display
```

### Integration Approach
- **Hook-Based**: Leverages React patterns for state management
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Built on `useDoseLogging`, `useFeedbackStorage`
- **Modular Design**: Components can be reused in different contexts
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Adds value without breaking existing features

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Caching**: Repeated calculations are cached
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking user interface
- **Minimal Bundle Impact**: Efficient code splitting ready

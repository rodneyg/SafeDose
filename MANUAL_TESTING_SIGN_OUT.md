# Manual Testing Guide for Sign Out Functionality

## Overview
This document describes how to manually test the updated sign out functionality.

## Test Steps

### Test 1: Basic Sign Out Flow
1. Open the app and ensure you're signed in (anonymous or authenticated)
2. Click the "Sign Out" button
3. **Expected**: 
   - User should see "Signed out successfully" message
   - After 2 seconds, user should be automatically signed back in anonymously
   - The sign out should feel responsive and show visual feedback

### Test 2: Sign Out During Loading
1. Sign out and immediately try to interact with the app
2. **Expected**: 
   - App should handle the transition gracefully
   - No crashes or unexpected behavior during the 2-second delay

### Test 3: Multiple Rapid Sign Outs
1. Try clicking sign out multiple times quickly
2. **Expected**: 
   - Only one sign out should process
   - No memory leaks or multiple timeouts

### Test 4: Sign In During Sign Out Delay
1. Click sign out
2. Before the 2-second delay completes, manually sign in (if possible)
3. **Expected**: 
   - Timeout should be cleared
   - User should remain signed in without automatic anonymous re-signin

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Memory Leak Fix**: Added proper cleanup of setTimeout to prevent memory leaks
2. **Visual Feedback**: Users now see "Signed out successfully" message for 2 seconds
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling in logout function
4. **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests for the sign out logic
5. **Z-Index Fix**: Fixed menu overlay z-index conflict that prevented logout button from working
6. **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added detailed console logging to track sign out flow

## Files Modified

- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`: Fixed timeout cleanup, improved sign out flow, added debug logging
- `components/IntroScreen.tsx`: Fixed z-index issue, updated UI, enhanced debug logging
- `contexts/AuthContext.test.tsx`: Added tests for sign out functionality
- `__mocks__/react-native.js`: Updated mock to support additional components
- `components/IntroScreen.test.tsx`: Added new tests for sign out button functionality
- `SIGN_OUT_BUTTON_FIX_TESTING.md`: Added comprehensive testing guide for the fix

## Technical Details

The key improvement is in the `useEffect` cleanup:

```typescript
return () => {
  unsubscribe();
  if (timeoutId) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  }
};
```

This ensures that if the component unmounts during the 2-second delay, the timeout is properly cleaned up, preventing potential memory leaks or attempts to set state on unmounted components.

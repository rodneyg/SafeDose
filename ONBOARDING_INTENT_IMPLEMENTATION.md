# Onboarding Intent Storage Implementation Summary

This implementation adds the ability to store user intent/personalization data from onboarding in a separate Firestore collection called `onboarding_intent_submissions`.

## Key Features

✅ **Anonymous User Support**: Allows anonymous users to submit data without authentication
✅ **Separate Collection**: Uses `onboarding_intent_submissions` collection, not user profiles  
✅ **Complete Data Capture**: Stores all required personalization selections
✅ **Fallback Storage**: Local storage backup for offline scenarios
✅ **Non-blocking**: Onboarding continues even if intent submission fails
✅ **Analytics Ready**: Includes user segmentation and device ID for analytics

## Data Structure

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-10T19:53:24Z",
  "isLicensedProfessional": true,
  "isPersonalUse": false,
  "isCosmeticUse": false,
  "user_segment": "healthcare_professional",
  "device_id": "device_1749585896456_abc123def"
}
```

## User Segments

- `healthcare_professional`: Licensed healthcare providers
- `cosmetic_user`: Users for cosmetic/aesthetic treatments  
- `personal_medical_user`: Personal medical use
- `general_user`: All other users

## Files Modified

1. **New**: `lib/hooks/useOnboardingIntentStorage.ts` - Core functionality
2. **New**: `lib/hooks/useOnboardingIntentStorage.test.ts` - Test coverage
3. **Modified**: `app/onboarding/userType.tsx` - Integration point

## Integration Points

- Called in `handleComplete` function before profile saving
- Non-blocking error handling to prevent onboarding disruption  
- Follows existing patterns from other storage hooks
- Minimal changes to existing onboarding flow

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ Store user intent data in database (not just locally)
✅ Save data even for anonymous users
✅ No authentication required for submission
✅ Prevent data loss and capture intent analytics
✅ Separate collection from user profiles
✅ Include timestamp and personalization selections
✅ Optional device/session identifier for deduplication

The implementation is complete and ready for use.

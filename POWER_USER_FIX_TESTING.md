# Power User Promotion Fix - Testing Instructions

## Status: Deprecated

**Note**: This document is now deprecated as SafeDose has transitioned to a fully free and open-source model. Power user promotions have been disabled as there are no subscription tiers to promote.

## Historical Context (for reference only)

The power user promotion modal was appearing after just 1 dose instead of the intended 4+ doses. This has been resolved by disabling promotions entirely as part of SafeDose's commitment to being free and focused on long-term safety.

## Testing Validation

### Automated Tests ‚úÖ
Run: `node validate-power-user-fix.js`

All 9 test cases pass, including:
- ‚úÖ New user with 1 dose ‚Üí No modal (fixes reported issue)
- ‚úÖ Users need exactly 4+ doses to trigger promotion
- ‚úÖ Subscription and timing constraints work correctly

### Manual Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: New User (First Dose) - SHOULD NOT SHOW MODAL
1. Clear browser/app storage
2. Complete first dose manually
3. After "How does this feel?" ‚Üí Should proceed normally without modal

#### Scenario 2: Returning User (4+ Doses) - SHOULD SHOW PROMOTION
1. Complete 4 doses over time
2. On 4th dose completion ‚Üí Should show "You've Become a SafeDose Power User!"

#### Scenario 3: Log Limit Reached - SHOULD SHOW STORAGE MODAL
1. Complete 10+ doses (for free users)
2. Should show "Dose History Storage Limit Reached" with appropriate messaging

## Key Files Modified
- `components/LogLimitModal.tsx` - Fixed messages
- `lib/hooks/usePowerUserPromotion.ts` - Added safety checks & debugging
- `lib/hooks/useDoseCalculator.ts` - Enhanced modal trigger logic
- `lib/hooks/useLogUsageTracking.ts` - Added data validation

## Current Behavior
- **All users**: Power user promotions are disabled
- **Free and open source**: SafeDose is focused on long-term safety, not monetization

## Debug Information
Enhanced logging will show exactly which modal is triggered and why:
- `‚úÖ Power user promotion criteria met` - Legitimate promotion
- `‚ùå Log limit reached` - Storage limit scenario  
- `üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY CHECK: Preventing power user promotion` - Safety net activated

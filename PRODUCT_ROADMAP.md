## Compliance & Security Assessment

### HIPAA Compliance Analysis 🏥

#### **Current Risk Level**: ⚠️ **MODERATE-HIGH**

SafeDose handles personal health information (PHI) through medication dosing data, requiring HIPAA compliance consideration.

#### **PHI Data Flows Identified**:

1. **Dose Calculations & History**
   - **Risk**: High - Contains medication names, dosages, timestamps
   - **Current State**: Stored in Firebase without encryption
   - **Mitigation Needed**: End-to-end encryption, audit logging

2. **User Profile Information**
   - **Risk**: Medium - Contains age, usage patterns
   - **Current State**: Firebase storage with basic security
   - **Mitigation Needed**: Data minimization policies

3. **AI Scanning Results**
   - **Risk**: Medium - May contain medication identifying information
   - **Current State**: Sent to OpenAI for processing
   - **Mitigation Needed**: Data processing agreements, anonymization

#### **Required HIPAA Safeguards**:

| Category | Current Status | Required Actions | Priority |
|----------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| **Administrative** | ⚠️ Partial | Privacy policies, security training, BAAs | High |
| **Physical** | ✅ Adequate | Cloud infrastructure security (Firebase/OpenAI) | Medium |
| **Technical** | ⚠️ Partial | Encryption, access controls, audit logging | Critical |

### Privacy & Security Risk Matrix

#### **Critical Risks** 🔴

1. **Unencrypted PHI Storage**
   - **Impact**: High - HIPAA violation, data breach risk
   - **Likelihood**: High - Current Firebase implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Implement client-side encryption before Firebase storage

2. **Third-Party Data Sharing (OpenAI)**
   - **Impact**: High - PHI exposure to external service
   - **Likelihood**: Medium - Every AI scan request
   - **Mitigation**: Data processing agreement, image anonymization

3. **Lack of User Consent Framework**
   - **Impact**: Medium - Legal compliance risk
   - **Likelihood**: High - No explicit PHI consent currently
   - **Mitigation**: Implement informed consent flow

#### **Medium Risks** 🟡

1. **Anonymous User Data Handling**
   - **Impact**: Medium - Unclear data ownership
   - **Likelihood**: Medium - Many anonymous users
   - **Mitigation**: Clear anonymous data policies

2. **Cross-Border Data Transfer**
   - **Impact**: Medium - International compliance complexity
   - **Likelihood**: High - Global user base potential
   - **Mitigation**: Data residency options, regional compliance

### Recommended Compliance Architecture

```
User Device (Encrypted) → Firebase (Encrypted) → Analytics (Anonymized)
        ↓
    OpenAI API (Anonymized Images Only)
```

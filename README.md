## üí° Core Calculation Logic and Verification

This section details the underlying logic for dose calculations and how to verify its accuracy.

### Calculation Engine: `lib/doseUtils.ts`

The heart of SafeDose's calculation capabilities resides in the `lib/doseUtils.ts` file. This module is responsible for:

*   **Unit Compatibility Validation (`validateUnitCompatibility`):** Before any calculation, this function checks if the provided dose unit (e.g., mg, mcg, units, mL) is compatible with the concentration unit (e.g., mg/ml, mcg/ml, units/ml). For example, it ensures that a dose in 'mg' can be calculated with a concentration in 'mg/ml' or 'mcg/ml' (allowing for conversion), but flags an incompatibility with 'units/ml'. Doses in 'mL' are treated as direct volume measurements and are compatible with any concentration unit for validation purposes.
*   **Determining Compatible Concentration Units (`getCompatibleConcentrationUnits`):** This function provides a list of appropriate concentration units based on a given dose unit. This is used to guide the user in the UI, ensuring they only select valid combinations.
*   **Dose Calculation (`calculateDose`):** This is the primary function that performs the actual dose calculation. It takes into account:
    *   The dose value and its unit.
    *   The medication's concentration and its unit.
    *   Potential on-the-fly concentration calculation if the user provides the total amount of medication in a vial and the volume of solution it's mixed with (e.g., for reconstituted medications).
    *   Unit conversions (e.g., mg to mcg) when the dose unit and concentration base unit differ.
    *   The selected syringe type ('Insulin' or 'Standard') and its specific volume/markings to recommend the most accurate marking for drawing the dose.
    *   It returns the calculated volume in mL, the recommended syringe marking (in mL for standard syringes, in units for insulin syringes), and any potential errors or warnings (e.g., dose exceeding syringe capacity, dose exceeding total available medication, or guidance for measuring doses that fall between syringe markings).

### UI Integration: `lib/hooks/useDoseCalculator.ts`

The user interface (UI) for dose calculation is managed by the `useDoseCalculator` custom React hook, located in `lib/hooks/useDoseCalculator.ts`. This hook orchestrates the multi-step calculation process:

*   It collects all necessary inputs from the user (dose, units, concentration, syringe type, etc.) across various screens.
*   It utilizes the validation functions (`validateUnitCompatibility`, `getCompatibleConcentrationUnits`) from `lib/doseUtils.ts` to provide real-time feedback and guide the user.
*   Once all inputs are gathered, it calls the `calculateDose` function from `lib/doseUtils.ts` with the user-provided parameters.
*   The results (calculated volume, recommended marking, errors) are then stored in the hook's state and presented to the user through the UI components.
*   It also manages flows for post-calculation feedback, surveys, and dose logging.

### Auditing and Verifying Calculations

Ensuring the accuracy and safety of dose calculations is paramount. To audit and verify the logic:

1.  **Primary Logic Review:** The most critical file for review is `lib/doseUtils.ts`. The JSDoc comments within this file explain the parameters, return values, and any complex logic or edge cases for each function. Pay close attention to:
    *   `calculateDose`: For the core calculation formula, unit conversions, and syringe marking logic.
    *   `validateUnitCompatibility`: For the rules governing which units can be calculated together.
2.  **State Management and UI Flow:** The `lib/hooks/useDoseCalculator.ts` hook controls how data flows from the UI to the calculation functions and back. Review its JSDoc comments and inline comments to understand how state is managed and how `doseUtils.ts` functions are invoked.
3.  **Unit Tests:** (If applicable) Review the unit tests associated with `lib/doseUtils.ts`. These tests should cover various scenarios, including different unit combinations, edge cases (e.g., zero values, very small or large values), and specific syringe calculations. _Note: Specific test file paths would be listed here if known; typically found in a `__tests__` directory or with a `.test.ts` extension._
4.  **Manual Verification:** Perform manual calculations for a diverse set of scenarios (different drugs, concentrations, dose units, syringe types) and compare your results against those provided by the application.

By examining these files and processes, the calculation logic can be thoroughly audited and its accuracy verified.

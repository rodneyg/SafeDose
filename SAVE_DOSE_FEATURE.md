# Save This Dose Feature Implementation

## Overview
This feature adds an optional "Save this dose" button to the final result screen that requires Google authentication and drives user logins for future monetization.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `components/FinalResultDisplay.tsx` - Added save button and authentication flow

### Key Features
1. **Optional Save Button**: Added as third button alongside existing "Start Over" and "New Dose" buttons
2. **Authentication Requirement**: Triggers Google sign-in flow for anonymous users
3. **Seamless Flow**: Automatically saves dose after successful authentication
4. **Proper Loading States**: Shows "Signing in..." and "Saving..." states
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks with user-friendly alerts

### User Experience Flow
1. User completes dose calculation and sees final result
2. User clicks "Save this dose" button
3. If user is not authenticated:
   - Google sign-in popup is triggered
   - After successful sign-in, dose is automatically saved
   - User sees "Dose Saved" confirmation
4. If user is already authenticated:
   - Dose is saved immediately
   - User sees "Dose Saved" confirmation

### Technical Implementation
- **Authentication**: Uses existing Google sign-in implementation from `IntroScreen`
- **Dose Logging**: Integrates with existing `useDoseLogging` hook
- **State Management**: Uses `useEffect` to detect auth state changes and trigger automatic save
- **UI Consistency**: Follows existing button design patterns and responsive layout

### Button Layout
The button container uses flexbox with `flex: 1` for each button, so the three buttons automatically adjust to equal widths:
```
[Start Over] [Save this dose] [New Dose]
```

### Integration Points
- Uses `useAuth()` context for authentication state
- Uses `useDoseLogging()` hook for saving functionality
- Leverages existing Google sign-in provider configuration
- No changes required to parent components

### Benefits
1. **Drives User Logins**: Creates incentive for users to authenticate
2. **Sets Up Monetization**: Establishes log-based feature foundation
3. **Habit Building**: Encourages users to save and track their doses
4. **Minimal Disruption**: Adds new functionality without changing existing flows

## Testing
- Build process completed successfully
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Consistent with existing code patterns
- Responsive design maintained

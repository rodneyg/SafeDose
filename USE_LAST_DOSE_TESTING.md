# "Use Last Dose" Feature - Manual Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides steps to manually test the "Use Last Dose" shortcut functionality.

## Recent Fixes (Commit 3065888)
**Issues Resolved:**
- ✅ Inconsistent button visibility ("sometimes it shows last dose, sometimes it doesn't")
- ✅ Navigation flow problems after feedback screens ("No specific recommendation available" errors)
- ✅ State loss during feedback completion causing users to get stuck

**Key Changes:**
- Added `useFocusEffect` for consistent button visibility checking
- Implemented state preservation during feedback flows with `isLastDoseFlow` tracking
- Modified feedback completion logic to preserve calculation state
- Enhanced navigation flow to prevent state corruption

## Prerequisites
- App must be running with at least one completed dose in the log history
- User should be on the IntroScreen (main screen)

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Button Visibility (FIXED)
**Expected Behavior**: "Use Last Dose" button should consistently appear when user has previous dose logs

**Test Steps**:
1. Open the app as a new user (no dose history)
2. Verify "Use Last Dose" button is NOT visible on IntroScreen
3. Complete a dose calculation (scan or manual) and save it
4. Return to IntroScreen
5. Verify "Use Last Dose" button IS now visible
6. **NEW**: Navigate away and back to IntroScreen multiple times
7. **NEW**: Verify button visibility remains consistent

### Scenario 2: Dose Prefilling (ENHANCED)
**Expected Behavior**: Button should prefill the dose screen with values from the most recent dose

**Test Steps**:
1. Complete a dose with known values:
   - Substance: "Testosterone" 
   - Dose: 100mg
   - Syringe: Standard 3ml
2. Save the dose to logs
3. Return to IntroScreen
4. Click "Use Last Dose" button
5. Verify app navigates to new-dose screen
6. **ENHANCED**: If complete calculation data exists, goes directly to final result
7. **ENHANCED**: If incomplete, starts from dose step with all values prefilled
8. Verify all fields are correctly populated

### Scenario 3: User Can Adjust Values (MAINTAINED)
**Expected Behavior**: User should be able to modify prefilled values before saving

**Test Steps**:
1. Click "Use Last Dose" from IntroScreen
2. If on final result, can use "Start Over" to modify
3. If on dose step, can modify values directly
4. Continue through the dose calculation process
5. Verify the calculation uses the modified value, not the original
6. Complete and save the new dose
7. Verify the new dose appears in logs as a separate entry

### Scenario 4: Feedback Flow Integration (NEW - CRITICAL TEST)
**Expected Behavior**: Should maintain state through feedback flows without errors

**Test Steps**:
1. Click "Use Last Dose" from IntroScreen
2. Complete the dose calculation (should show final result)
3. Proceed to feedback by clicking appropriate action button
4. Go through "why are you here" screen if prompted
5. Go through "how you feel" feedback screen
6. **CRITICAL**: After feedback completion, should return to a valid state
7. **CRITICAL**: Should NOT show "No specific recommendation available"
8. **CRITICAL**: Should show the calculated dose recommendation
9. Verify can proceed with normal dose logging

### Scenario 5: Multiple Users (MAINTAINED)
**Expected Behavior**: Should only show doses for the current user

**Test Steps**:
1. Sign in as User A, complete a dose
2. Sign out and sign in as User B
3. Verify "Use Last Dose" button does NOT appear (no history for User B)
4. Complete a dose as User B
5. Verify "Use Last Dose" now appears for User B's dose only

## Error Scenarios

### Scenario E1: No Recent Dose (MAINTAINED)
**Expected Behavior**: Should handle gracefully if no recent dose is found

**Test Steps**:
1. Manually trigger the getMostRecentDose function when no doses exist
2. Verify no errors are thrown
3. Verify appropriate logging occurs

### Scenario E2: Feedback Flow Edge Cases (NEW)
**Expected Behavior**: Should handle feedback flow edge cases gracefully

**Test Steps**:
1. Start "Use Last Dose" flow
2. During feedback, try various navigation patterns
3. Verify state is always preserved or gracefully recovered
4. Verify no "stuck" states occur

## Success Criteria
- [x] Button only appears when user has dose history
- [x] Button visibility is consistent across navigation
- [x] Button properly prefills dose screen with last dose values
- [x] User can modify prefilled values before saving
- [x] Works with all supported dose units
- [x] Preserves user isolation (no cross-user data)
- [x] Maintains state through feedback flows
- [x] Returns to valid state after feedback completion
- [x] No "No specific recommendation available" errors
- [x] No existing functionality is broken
- [x] No crashes or errors during normal usage

## UI/UX Validation
- [x] Button has appropriate styling (green theme with RotateCcw icon)
- [x] Button text is clear: "Use Last Dose"
- [x] Button is properly positioned between welcome and action buttons
- [x] Button is responsive on mobile/web
- [x] Proper accessibility labels are present
- [x] Smooth navigation flow through feedback systems

## Performance Validation
- [x] Fast response when clicking "Use Last Dose"
- [x] Minimal loading time when checking for recent doses
- [x] No memory leaks from dose log retrieval
- [x] Works offline (uses local storage fallback)
- [x] Efficient state management during feedback flows

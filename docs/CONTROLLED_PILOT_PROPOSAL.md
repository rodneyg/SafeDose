## Executive Summary

This document outlines a controlled pilot program for SafeDose, an AI-assisted dose calculator for injectable medications. The pilot is designed to validate safety measures, assess real-world accuracy, and establish protocols for safe deployment while minimizing risk to participants.

**Key Objectives:**
- Validate dose calculation accuracy in real-world settings (>99% target)
- Test safety mechanisms and error handling
- Establish monitoring and incident response protocols
- Gather user feedback for product improvement
- Build evidence for broader deployment

**Duration:** 12 weeks (3 phases of 4 weeks each)

**Target Participants:** 30-50 healthcare professionals and experienced patients

## 1. Pilot Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The controlled pilot serves to:

1. **Validate Safety Systems**: Test all built-in safety measures (volume thresholds, error detection, pre-dose confirmation)
2. **Measure Accuracy**: Compare SafeDose calculations against manual verification by healthcare professionals
3. **Identify Edge Cases**: Discover failure modes not captured in current evaluation framework
4. **Refine User Experience**: Gather feedback on usability, clarity, and workflow integration
5. **Build Trust**: Generate evidence-based data on safety and accuracy
6. **Establish Protocols**: Develop incident response and monitoring procedures for wider release

### 1.2 Scope

**In Scope:**
- Manual dose entry calculations

## 14. Conclusion

This controlled pilot program represents a measured, safety-first approach to validating SafeDose in real-world settings. By progressing through three carefully designed phases with clear success criteria, safety measures, and monitoring protocols, we can:

1. **Build Evidence**: Generate rigorous data on safety and accuracy
2. **Minimize Risk**: Protect participants through multiple safety layers
3. **Gather Insights**: Learn from real-world use to improve the product
4. **Establish Trust**: Demonstrate commitment to safety and transparency
5. **Enable Broader Impact**: Create foundation for wider deployment

The pilot acknowledges that SafeDose is a tool to assist, not replace, professional judgment. Through mandatory verification, comprehensive training, and robust monitoring, we can validate its value while maintaining the highest safety standards.

Success will be measured not just by accuracy metrics, but by:
- Zero critical safety incidents
- High participant confidence and satisfaction
- Sustainable monitoring and support models
- Clear path forward for broader deployment
- Contribution to medical technology safety knowledge

We approach this pilot with humility, recognizing that we are handling a tool that impacts human health. Every safeguard, every verification requirement, every monitoring system is designed with one goal: ensuring that SafeDose helps people safely manage their medications.

# PMF Survey Implementation

## Overview

The Superhuman PMF (Product-Market Fit) Survey implementation follows the Rahul Vohra method to gather insights from early adopters. This feature helps identify strongest use cases, understand what to charge for, and prioritize future premium features.

## Key Features

### Trigger Conditions
- **After 2nd dose session** (manual or AI/scan) - Users have enough experience to provide meaningful feedback
- **One-time only** - never shows again once completed or dismissed
- **Works for anonymous users** - no authentication required

### Survey Questions
1. **How would you feel if you could no longer use SafeDose?**
   - Very disappointed
   - Somewhat disappointed  
   - Not disappointed

2. **What type of person do you think would most benefit from SafeDose?** (Free text)

3. **What is the main benefit you've received from using SafeDose so far?** (Free text)

4. **How can we improve SafeDose for you?** (Free text)

### UX Design
- **One question at a time** (Typeform/Cal.com style)
- **Progress indicator** showing current question (X of 4)
- **Back navigation** available between questions
- **Skip/dismiss option** with clear "X" button
- **Mobile-responsive** design

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### `usePMFSurvey` Hook
```typescript
// Session tracking and trigger logic
const { triggerData, recordDoseSession, submitPMFSurvey, skipPMFSurvey } = usePMFSurvey();

// Records each dose completion
await recordDoseSession('scan' | 'manual');

// Check if survey should show
triggerData.shouldShowSurvey; // true on 2nd session (if not shown before)
```

#### `PMFSurveyModal` Component
- Step-by-step question interface
- Form validation for multiple choice and text inputs
- Progress tracking and analytics

#### Integration with Dose Flow
```typescript
// In useDoseCalculator.ts
const handleGoToFeedback = async (nextAction) => {
  // Record dose session for PMF tracking
  const triggerData = await pmfSurvey.recordDoseSession(sessionType);
  
  // Show PMF survey first if conditions met
  if (triggerData.shouldShowSurvey) {
    setScreenStep('pmfSurvey');
  } else {
    setScreenStep('postDoseFeedback'); // Regular feedback
  }
};
```

### Storage Strategy

#### Local Storage (AsyncStorage)
```typescript
// Session count tracking
pmf_session_count_${userId}: "2"

// Survey shown state
pmf_survey_data_${userId}: {
  "hasShownBefore": true,
  "shownAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

#### Firebase Storage

**Note**: Firebase storage is only available for authenticated users due to security rules. Anonymous users' responses are stored locally only.

```typescript
// Collection: pmf_survey_responses (authenticated users only)
{
  id: "pmf_1234567890_abc123",
  userId: "authenticated-user-id",
  sessionId: "pmf_1234567890_abc123", 
  deviceType: "web",
  timestamp: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  responses: {
    disappointment: "very_disappointed",
    benefitPerson: "Healthcare professionals",
    mainBenefit: "Accurate calculations", 
    improvements: "Better mobile interface"
  },
  metadata: {
    sessionCount: 1,
    scanFlow: true, // true = scan, false = manual
    completedAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Analytics Events

```typescript
// Survey lifecycle
PMF_SURVEY_SHOWN: 'pmf_survey_shown'
PMF_SURVEY_QUESTION_ANSWERED: 'pmf_survey_question_answered' 
PMF_SURVEY_COMPLETED: 'pmf_survey_completed'
PMF_SURVEY_SKIPPED: 'pmf_survey_skipped'
PMF_SURVEY_DISMISSED: 'pmf_survey_dismissed'
```

## User Flow

```
Dose Completion → Record Session → Check PMF Trigger
                                       ↓
                                 (2nd session?)
                                       ↓
                               [PMF Survey Modal]
                                  ↓        ↓
                             Complete   Skip/Dismiss
                                  ↓        ↓
                            [Mark as Shown]
                                       ↓
                            [Regular Post-Dose Feedback]
                                       ↓
                              [Continue to Next Action]
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- `pmf-survey-logic.test.ts` - Core trigger logic
- `pmf-survey-integration.test.ts` - User flow scenarios  
- `usePMFSurvey.test.tsx` - Hook functionality

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Does NOT trigger on 1st session (users need more experience)
- ✅ Trigger on 2nd session if not shown before
- ✅ Never trigger after 2nd session
- ✅ Never trigger if already shown
- ✅ Session tracking (scan vs manual)
- ✅ Question flow and validation
- ✅ Response structure

## Privacy & Data

- **Anonymous user support** - Works without authentication
- **Local-first storage** - Continues working offline
- **Optional cloud sync** - Firebase backup for authenticated users
- **Non-blocking** - Survey failures don't break app functionality
- **One-time collection** - Respects user privacy by not being intrusive

## Future Enhancements

- **Analytics dashboard** for product insights
- **Response analysis** and categorization
- **A/B testing** different question variations
- **Trigger customization** based on user segments
- **Export functionality** for product team analysis

## "Reference" Tab Flow

The "Reference" tab provides users with access to informational and educational content within the application.

*   **Tab Name:** Reference
*   **Access:** Users can navigate to this section by selecting the "Reference" tab from the main application's bottom tab navigator. It is typically represented by a **BookOpen icon**.

### Purpose and Content

The primary purpose of the "Reference" tab is to offer users a repository of helpful information, guidelines, and educational materials pertinent to medication dosage, application usage, safety protocols, and other related topics. This feature aims to empower users with knowledge and support their understanding of best practices.

**Expected Content and Functionality:**

While the specific content can vary, the "Reference" tab is generally expected to include:

*   **Information Display:**
    *   A primary view, likely scrollable, listing various reference articles, topics, or documents.
    *   Content could range from concise FAQs and quick guides to more detailed articles or protocols.
*   **Content Nature:**
    *   The information presented is typically static (embedded within the app) or dynamically fetched from a Content Management System (CMS) or a dedicated backend service. This allows for updates and additions without requiring an app update.
*   **Potential Features:**
    *   **Categorization:** Content might be organized into logical categories or sections (e.g., "Medication Information," "Device Guides," "Safety Procedures," "FAQs") to improve navigation and browsability.
    *   **Search Functionality:** A search bar could be included, allowing users to quickly find specific information by typing keywords.
    *   **Links to External Resources:** Where appropriate, the tab might contain links to reputable external websites, such as medical bodies, drug information databases, or regulatory agencies, for further reading.
    *   **Glossary:** A glossary of terms relevant to medication dosage and the app's functionality could be provided.
    *   **Instructional Materials:** This could include how-to guides for using specific app features or understanding complex calculation aspects.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Each reference item would likely be selectable, leading to a detail view where the full content of the article or topic is displayed.
    *   The design would prioritize readability and ease of access to information.

In essence, the "Reference" tab acts as an in-app library or knowledge base, supporting the user's journey by providing readily accessible and relevant information.

## Settings Flow

The "Settings" screen provides users with access to manage their account, subscription, application preferences, and find support information.

*   **Screen Name:** Settings
*   **Access:**
    *   While the exact entry point is not explicitly detailed in the provided file information, settings screens are conventionally accessed via:
        *   A **gear icon** (⚙️) or a "Settings" text link.
        *   This button is often located in a main navigation menu, a user profile screen, or sometimes directly on a tab bar if space and design permit. For this app, it might be accessible from a user profile area linked from one of the main tabs or a modal.

### Current Explicit Functionality (from `app/settings.tsx`)

*   **"Cancel Subscription" Button:**
    *   A button labeled "Cancel Subscription" is present on this screen.
    *   **Action:** When pressed, it currently logs an analytics event: `ANALYTICS_EVENTS.CANCEL_SUBSCRIPTION`.
    *   **Implementation Status:** A comment (`// TODO: Add real cancellation or downgrade logic`) within `app/settings.tsx` indicates that the actual backend logic for subscription cancellation or downgrading user plans is not yet fully implemented. Pressing the button currently only serves an analytical tracking purpose.

### Implied and Potential Functionality

Based on common application patterns and the existing "Cancel Subscription" feature, the "Settings" screen is likely intended to host or link to the following functionalities:

*   **User Account Management:**
    *   **Authentication State:** The options displayed would likely differ based on whether the user is logged in or using the app anonymously.
    *   **Login / Sign Up:** If the user is anonymous or logged out, a prominent "Login" or "Sign In / Sign Up" button would be available, navigating them to the `app/login.tsx` screen to authenticate or create an account.
    *   **Logout:** For authenticated users, a "Logout" button would allow them to sign out of their account.
    *   **Profile Details:** Options to view or edit user profile information. This might include:
        *   Email address or other account identifiers.
        *   Preferences initially set during onboarding (e.g., user background like "Healthcare Professional" vs. "General User", primary use type like "Medical" vs. "Cosmetic").
        *   Password change functionality.

*   **Subscription Management:**
    *   The presence of a "Cancel Subscription" button strongly implies a subscription model for the application.
    *   **View Current Plan:** Display information about the user's current subscription tier (e.g., Free, Premium).
    *   **Upgrade/Change Plan:** Links or buttons leading to `app/pricing.tsx` or a dedicated subscription management page where users can view different plans, upgrade their subscription, or manage payment methods.
    *   The "Cancel Subscription" button would be part of this section.

*   **Application Preferences:**
    *   **Notifications:** Settings to enable or disable push notifications if the app uses them (e.g., for reminders, updates).
    *   **Appearance:** If the app supports multiple themes, a toggle for Light Mode / Dark Mode could be present.
    *   **Data & Privacy:** Options related to data usage, personalization, or privacy settings.

*   **Information & Support:**
    *   **About:**
        *   App version number.
        *   Links to "Terms of Service."
        *   Links to "Privacy Policy."
    *   **Help / Support:**
        *   Links to an FAQ section (potentially part of the "Reference" tab or a separate web view).
        *   Contact information or a form to reach customer support.
        *   Option to submit feedback (though this might also be handled by the dedicated feedback flow after dose calculation).

The "Settings" screen acts as a central hub for users to control their experience with the application, manage their account, and access important informational resources. The `app/settings.tsx` file serves as the entry point for these functionalities, though some, like detailed subscription management or login, might navigate to other dedicated screens (`app/pricing.tsx`, `app/login.tsx`).
